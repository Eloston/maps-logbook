# Maps Logbook

**NOTE: This app is not in a usable state yet**

Save locations and routes from Google Maps via the sharing functionality.

Google Maps does not need to be signed-in for this app to function. But this app will function normally if Google Maps is signed-in.

## Usage

When sharing a location or route from Google Maps, select this app to share to. This will add an entry to a list of saved locations and routes.

To use a saved location or route, select an entry in this app and have the Google Maps app handle the action.

The rest of the UI tries to follow Material Guidelines, so it should be self-explanatory.
